Leveraging its decades of experience in the tourism industry and its extensive knowledge of regional and global travel trends and consumer preferences, Almosafer will actively promote Red Sea Global’s destinations through diverse channels to increase the visibility of the world-class hotels and pristine, diverse ecosystems and natural wonders at The Red Sea, AMAALA and Thuwal Private Retreat.\n\nBoth parties will host several in-depth workshops and specialised training services to enable Almosafer to craft tailored and immersive travel experiences for RSG’s luxury destinations for inbound and domestic travellers. Targeted workshops aimed at enhancing the luxury destinations’ appeal to the local market and equipping Almosafer’s sales agents with the knowledge and skills to showcase Red Sea Global’s destinations as unparalleled luxury experiences will also be part of the strategic initiatives under the partnership.\n\nIn addition, the two entities will collaborate on targeted marketing and promotion campaigns to raise awareness among end consumers, highlighting the destination's unique offerings and positioning it as a must-visit luxury tourism hotspot to drive demand. Almosafer will also curate customised experiences and promote the destination's richness and diversity across various channels, including Almosafer’s consumer travel platform, its Corporate Travel segment; and Discover Saudi, its Destination Management Company. \n\n**Commenting on the collaboration, Muzzammil Ahussain, CEO, Almosafer, said:** \"The partnership with Red Sea Global reflects our shared vision for redefining luxury travel and shaping the future of luxury tourism in Saudi Arabia. It is an honour to contribute to the elevation of The Red Sea, AMAALA and Thuwal Private Retreat as unparalleled destinations of choice for a discerning clientele.  We are excited to leverage our geographical reach and decades of experience to position them as the ultimate destinations that set new standards in bespoke tourism experiences.”\n\nJohn Pagano, Group CEO at Red Sea Global, said: “Today we have three world-class luxury resorts open at The Red Sea. Over the coming 12-18 months we’ll be opening a further 13 hotels, plus eight at AMAALA and our private island resort, Thuwal Private Retreat. More broadly, our growing portfolio is set to unlock the tourism potential of the Red Sea coast for all segments of travel with a diverse range of experiences and offerings. With Almosafer’s support, we will help travelers discover just how special this part of the world is, from the pristine coastline and breathtaking coral reefs, to the stunning dunescapes and wadis.”\n\nWith 79 hotels in total, The Red Sea and AMAALA are projected to contribute SAR 33 billion (USD 8.79 billion) annually to the Kingdom’s economy upon completion. Both destinations sit on a combined land of more than 32,000km2. Three hotels at The Red Sea destination are open, along with the first phase of Red Sea International Airport, and the project is scheduled for full completion in 2030. The destination is off grid, powered solely by sunlight, with some 760,000 solar panels now in place.\n\nSet against the backdrop of stunning landscapes and pristine ecosystems, AMAALA will provide guests with transformative personal wellness journeys and aims to open eight resorts under Phase One in 2025. Opening in 2024, Thuwal Private Retreat is the third destination to be developed by RSG and the first to be owned and operated exclusively by the developer.\n",

         "title":"Saudi Travellers Making the Most of Trips: Almosafer Report Unveils Domestic and International Travel Trends",
         "body":" As travel demand continues to grow for domestic & international trips, travellers continue/opt to spend more in-destination.\n\nSaudi travellers continue to exhibit a keen desire for travel as evidenced by the steady growth in demand for domestic and international travel, finds a new report by Almosafer, Saudi Arabia’s leading travel company.\n\nThe findings, revealed at the Arabian Travel Market (ATM), throw light on the current travel trends of Saudi travellers both domestically and internationally, with insights into their booking habits and travel preferences, based on proprietary booking data from Almosafer’s consumer travel platforms across the first four months of 2024.\n\n In terms of international destinations, Dubai, Doha, Manama, Cairo, and Istanbul remain the top favourites among Saudi travellers. At the same time, there has been a significant shift of focus towards South Asia and the Far East with Tokyo, Singapore, and Bangkok increasingly seeing more footfall from Saudi travellers. European capitals including Madrid and Amsterdam are also emerging as trending destinations for bookings made in the first four months of 2024.\n\nThe top destinations drawing Saudi travellers domestically continue to be Makkah, Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar and Abha. New hotspots like AlUla, Tabuk, and Hail are among the trending destinations this year.\n\nAs Saudi travellers continue to explore their country for leisure, 53% of total bookings made across Almosafer’s booking channels were recorded for the domestic segment, showcasing a continued demand for travel within the country. The sustained interest in domestic tourism showcases the success of government and private sector initiatives to boost local tourism, resulting in a 29% increase in total domestic booking volume across Almosafer channels. Flights alone saw a 27% increase while hotel bookings showcased nearly double at 40%, demonstrating robust domestic growth.\n\nSaudi travellers utilize the convenience of online booking channels with 91% of total bookings placed on Almosafer web, app, or mobile web products. However, for more complex itineraries or personal travel advisory, travellers opt for retail channels, with 9% off all bookings recorded across retail branches, call centers and WhatsApp. WhatsApp continues to rise as a vital booking channel with 12% of retail bookings coming through the instant messaging app. Overall WhatsApp bookings witnessed a 14% growth in volume in 2024.\n \nWhile Apple Pay continues to rise in popularity as a payment method (41% of all bookings in 2024 versus 36% in 2023), BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) is gaining traction amongst Saudi travellers, as the convenient payment method is expanding the pool of eligible travellers by making travel more affordable for new customer segments.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector booming, travellers are keen to make the most of their breaks as they focus on in-destination experiences. The addition of more flight routes, an increase in capacity, and the opening of new airports in the Kingdom has led to more affordable flight options on low-cost carriers (LCC), and while Saudi travellers are willing to spend on luxury stays (51% of hotel bookings are for 5* properties) and experiences, they are taking advantage of budget-friendly flight options.\n\nData showcases an overall jump from 55% in 2023 to 62% among travellers opting to fly low-cost this year. Internationally this year 46% of total bookings were done for low-cost carriers compared to 44% in 2023. Domestically, LCC bookings have seen a jump from 68% in 2023 to 72% in the total share of bookings in 2024.\n\nFor accommodation bookings, Saudi travellers depend on peer-to-peer recommendations which are gathering momentum, as 48% of travellers who book online browse and interact with the reviews from peers about the hotels, to ensure the property they are booking offers value for money.\n\nAlmosafer’s data simultaneously reveals a rising interest from Saudi travellers for Apartment rentals and Aparthotels, as these accommodation options offer a convenient alternative to hotels, especially for destinations with lower hotel availability, or for a flexible, convenient, and oftentimes more affordable stay.\n\nAparthotels alone have shown an impressive 73% growth in booking volume for international stays and an 84% increase in the domestic segment. Key destinations in KSA are seeing tremendous growth in alternative accommodation bookings such as Riyadh (+31%), Jeddah (+134%) and Al Khobar (+43%), while internationally, Dubai (+43%), Manama (60%) and Doha (+29%) are seeing significant growth. \n\nSaudi travellers are taking advantage of the increased offering for local activities. Concert tickets, Riyadh season passes, access to attractions, and culturally-focused events are among the top activities in demand, with the average booking window for these being as short as 3.5 days.  Riyadh, Jeddah, Makkah, and Dammam are the top cities within Saudi Arabia for leisure activities, while international travellers are booking activities in Dubai, Bangkok, Phuket, and Abu Dhabi.\n\n**Muzzammil Ahussain, Chief Executive Officer of Almosafer, said: **“Almosafer’s travel trend report showcases a vibrant domestic and international tourism sector, while Saudi travellers continue to explore their own country and destinations further afield. Our customers are finding more ways to get value from their trip, with convenience being a key factor in their travel decision-making. With affordable flight options, new accommodation offerings and flexible payment options, there is nothing holding travellers back from going on trips and making lifetime memories.”\n\nView the full report Here \nhttps://almosafer-corporate-website-assets-prod.almosafer.com/ALM_TREND_EN_1_7ae9e4324a.pdf\n\n*Report based on proprietary booking data from Almosafer’s Consumer Travel Business across omnichannel touchpoints. Comparisons are based on bookings placed between January 1 - April 20 in 2024 vs. January 1 - April 20, 2023.*",

         "body":"API connectivity with ZAAER’s portfolio of serviced apartments to distribute across Almosafer’s travel businesses   \n\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia; 29 January, 2024: Almosafer, Saudi Arabia’s leading travel company (part of Seera Group), has announced a strategic partnership with ZAAER, a pioneering cloud-based property management solution and accommodation switch, to offer an enhanced portfolio of services apartments across Almosafer’s portfolio of travel businesses serving domestic and inbound guests.\n\nZAAER offers a range of innovative technology solutions to enable owners and accommodation managers to manage their day-to-day operations, including inventory, housekeeping, finance, HR, reservations, check-in and check-out, room allocation, and more through an easy-to-use system, all dynamically linked to manage any size of accommodation.\n\nUnder the partnership, Almosafer will integrate ZAAER's serviced apartment offerings within its extensive portfolio of travel businesses through an API solution to enhance the travel experience for both B2B and B2C customers across domestic and international markets. This move will significantly expand Almosafer's comprehensive offerings with a wider range of accommodation options to suit all budgets. \n\nZAAER, which currently manages 700 serviced apartments, aims to ambitiously scale up its short-term rental stock to 2,000 high quality accommodation spaces in 2024.\n\nMuzzammil Ahussain, CEO, Almosafer, said: “As Saudi Arabia grows in appeal for the global traveller, the partnership with ZAAER builds on our digital capabilities to help address the upscale accommodation needs of a growing number of domestic and international tourists. Integrating the accommodation content of ZAAER on our state-of-the-art digital-first B2B and B2C platforms will facilitate real-time data exchange, ensuring a smoother and more interconnected experience for property owners, guests, and the travel ecosystem.”\n \nDr. Mohammad AlMubark, CEO, ZAAER, said: \"We are excited to partner with Almosafer to expand our reach to a broader audience across its integrated and high-performing digital platforms. The partnership marks a significant step in the evolution of the travel industry in Saudi Arabia as we seek to elevate the serviced apartment experience by combining Almosafer's expansive reach and customer-centric approach with our property solutions.”\n\nAs Saudi Arabia significantly expands its tourism sector with investments of USD1 trillion to attract 150 million tourists annually by the end of the decade under the transformative goals of Vision 2030, the collaboration between Almosafer and ZAAER underscores a commitment to providing unparalleled and seamless travel services to meet the growing needs of travellers in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nSaudi Arabia is today the world’s second fastest growing tourist destination, and is witnessing a surge in demand for flexible accommodation options across the Kingdom. The pipeline of mega and giga projects and infrastructural developments will further drive leisure and business tourism growth and create substantial opportunities in the short-term rental sector. This trend is particularly notable in key markets across the Kingdom, including the Holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, where the demand for high-quality accommodation is expected to rise substantially to welcome an estimated 30 million Umrah visitors by 2030.\n",

         "title":"Almosafer's comprehensive trends report highlights growth of thriving domestic tourism in Saudi Arabia in 2023",
         "body":"Domestic sector accounts for over 40% of booking share, reveals data collated across Almosafer’s consumer travel platforms\n\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia; 22 January, 2024: Almosafer, Saudi Arabia’s leading travel company (part of Seera Group), has revealed that Saudi travellers are showing a strong appetite for the diverse range of tourism offerings within the country, leading to impressive gains for the domestic tourism sector in 2023.\n\nA new domestic travel trends report unveiled by Almosafer, which draws on data insights collated from across the company’s consumer platforms during 2023, has found that over 40% of the total booking share comes from the domestic sector, with 83% of local travellers showing a preference for luxury accommodation options. With the average length of stay being two nights, the overall number of room nights for hotels have seen a 22% year on year growth in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nA key player in the travel and tourism industry in the Kingdom, Almosafer is accelerating efforts to boost domestic tourism and promote Saudi Arabia as one of the top travel destinations in the region by facilitating unforgettable journeys and creating seamless travel experiences for consumers across its business and consumer portals.  This is in line with Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 that aims to attract 150 million tourists annually by the start of the next decade, with half of its tourism demand to come from domestic travel.\n\nThe new trends report has further highlighted that among the top growing destinations in the Kingdom, AlUla is the preferred luxury option, Jazan and Tabuk are winter favourites and Abha is a popular destination for families to spend the summer break. Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam and Makkah & Madinah remain the most popular destinations in terms of room nights sold.\n\nThe booking behaviour of Saudi travellers across Almosafer’s consumer travel businesses, also reveal that the average order value has increased by 10.8% in 2023, even though close to 75% of consumers are choosing low-cost carriers to reach their destinations within the Kingdom. This indicates that domestic travellers are spending more on in-destination expenses including accommodation, and activities, whilst saving on their journeys.\n\nAs the alternative accommodation segment grows in Saudi Arabia, the overall share of bookings for short-term rental serviced apartments witnessed a YoY rise of 48%, compared to 2022. Almosafer is currently bridging the demand gap for competitive and flexible accommodation options through its strategic tie-ups with innovative digital platforms and alternative accommodation suppliers to meet the growing needs of diversified market segments in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMuzzammil Ahussain, CEO, Almosafer, said: “Our latest data showcases the continued growth of domestic tourism in Saudi Arabia, reflecting the Kingdom’s rise as an attractive destination for local travellers who are increasingly showing a preference to explore the wealth of both natural and cultural landscapes and experience the growing range of unique entertainment and adventure-based activities. As Vision 2030 drives further growth in this sector, Almosafer will continue to expand our reach and optimise our offerings for domestic tourists, as we shape the future of travel experiences within the Kingdom.”\n\nSaudi Arabia’s investments to boost the Kingdom’s tourism infrastructure has resulted in a steady rise of domestic tourists keen on exploring the many attractions in the Kingdom. Data from Almosafer’s platforms have highlighted a growing demand for activities and recreational pursuits among Saudi residents, primarily in the capital city of Riyadh and Jeddah, the Kingdom’s second largest city. \n\nApart from events and festivals, access to popular attractions such as aquariums, as well as beach access, personalised and experiential activities such as diving, snorkeling and other on ground adventure and nature-based activities are in great demand among domestic travellers. \n\nThrough its partnerships with key stakeholders in the industry, Almosafer continues to promote local activations and targeted campaigns to enhance their reach and offerings within the Kingdom to grow domestic tourism. It further supports SMEs in Saudi Arabia through Almosafer Activities, the first marketplace for tours, activities and more within the Kingdom, which is now fully integrated with Almosafer’s consumer channels and sells directly to domestic travellers.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n![domestic-trend-EN.jpg](https://almosafer-corporate-website-assets-prod.almosafer.com/domestic_trend_EN_f2c562af9e.jpg)\n\n\n",

Almosafer will also promote inbound tourism to its B2B customers in the Middle East and North Africa region through Mawasim, its Hajj and Umrah tour operator, and through Discover Saudi, its destination management company. \n\nThe agreement was signed by Fahad Alobailan, Chief Tourism Officer at Almosafer, and Munirah Abanomy, Head of Marketing Partnerships for Middle East & Africa at the Saudi Tourism Authority, at the Saudi Pavilion at the Arabian Travel Market.\n\nFahad Alobailan, Chief Tourism Officer at Almosafer, said: \"We continue to build on our longstanding relationship with the STA, working together to achieve the goals of Vision 2030. Saudi Arabia has a plethora of incredible cultural, natural, historical and religious attractions that are drawing in an increasing number of international tourists. We have seen a significant increase in demand for inbound tourism to the Kingdom and we will continue our role in enabling this continued growth.\"\n\nCommenting on this agreement, Abdulkarim Aldarwish, President of the Middle East & Africa Markets at the Saudi Tourism Authority, said: \"The Saudi Tourism Authority is keen to conclude fruitful agreements and strategic partnerships with major travel companies in the Kingdom. We look forward to achieving our common strategic goals and working to empower and advance business growth for our partners in the private tourism sector in the Kingdom. Through the agreement with Almosafer, we aim to attract tourists from regional markets, provide distinguished and diverse products, offers and packages, and promote unique tourist destinations, and international events in the kingdom throughout the year.\"\n\nThe agreement follows a recent announcement that Almosafer is partnering with STA to drive domestic tourism and further builds on the established partnership in which the two parties have collaborated on various successful initiatives to boost tourism in the Kingdom.\n\nAs the national champion of tourism in Saudi Arabia, Almosafer is supporting the tourism agenda of Saudi Vision 2030 which aims to develop the tourism sector to account for 10% the Kingdom’s GDP and to welcome 100 million visitors annually.

         "body":"Travel behaviour has seen a shift towards longer trip lengths and increased spend whilst domestic leisure trips are becoming increasingly popular.\n\nAlmosafer, Saudi Arabia’s leading travel company, has published a new report at the Arabian Travel Market, which reveals the latest travel trends of Saudi travellers venturing abroad and exploring their Kingdom domestically.\n\nThe report shows that the top international destinations for Saudi travellers include Dubai, Cairo, London, Istanbul and Doha. Since the resumption of travel to Türkiye in the summer of 2022, the destination has catapulted its way back to one of the top choices for Saudi travellers. Doha, on the other hand, has retained its appeal for Saudi travellers as a leisure destination, even after the World Cup in Q4 2022. Trending destinations include Rome, Bangkok and Seoul, with other Asian destinations also gaining popularity. \n\nThe report shows that the demand for domestic travel in the Kingdom remains very strong, even despite the full resumption of international travel. In the year to date, domestic bookings have accounted for 56% of total bookings, up from 47% for the same period pre-pandemic in 2019. On the domestic side, all-time favourite domestic destinations Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Makkah and Abha continue to dominate, whilst trending destinations for trips within KSA include AlUla, Taif and Najran. \n\nIn terms of booking channels, the data shows that 89% of total bookings are made online compared to 11% made offline, illustrating the seamless user experience offered by Almosafer’s omnichannel touchpoints, but also the need for advisory through WhatsApp, call centre or via retail branches for more complex itineraries. This is especially true for domestic bookings, where almost half (49%) of all bookings are placed via retail channels, indicating that Saudi travellers are seeking travel advisory services for leisure trips in their own country. \n\nAlmosafer’s report also shows that overall, Saudi travellers are spending more on longer trips. The average trip length has increased by 13% to 9.1 days, up from 8 days in 2019, whereas the average order value has increased by 15% since pre-pandemic. \n\nThe data shows that this shift is even more amplified in domestic trips. While domestic travel used to be driven by shorter trips for purposes such as visiting family, friends or for special occasions, Saudis are now considering their own country as a destination to explore, as they spend more money on longer leisure trips in the Kingdom.\n\nThere has also been a significant increase in the average length of domestic trips of 36% to 5-day trips in 2023 compared to 3.7 days in 2019. Longer trips mean that travellers are also spending more money with the average order value for domestic trips increasing by 40% in 2023 compared to 2019. The average booking window for domestic travel has also increased by 12% to 7.7 days in 2023, up from 6.9 days in 2019, suggesting that Saudis are spending more time to plan their domestic trips.\n\nOverall, bookings for five-star hotels have also increased from 46% of total hotel bookings in 2019 to 52% in 2023. This increase in spending mirrors the global trend as people are choosing more luxurious and meaningful experiences since travel has rebounded. Domestically, Saudis are also spending more money on luxury accommodation now that there is a wider range of options available with the introduction of luxury hotels and resort brands to the Kingdom in locations such as AlUla.\n\nTravellers are also showing an increasingly strong preference for low-cost carriers over full service carriers when booking flights. In 2023, bookings for low-cost carriers accounted for 62% of total flight bookings, up from 47% in 2019, while bookings for full-service carriers decreased from 53% in 2019 to 38% in 2023. This increase in bookings for low-cost carriers reflects the increase in capacity and routes, and travellers are opting for more economical flight choices while choosing to instead spend more at their destination. \n\nOther trends include an increase in the number of solo travellers who account for 24% of travellers in 2023, up from 14% in 2019; and for customers of Almosafer Concierge, the first luxury travel concierge service from Saudi Arabia, wellness experiences and luxury honeymoon island stays are emerging as the top trends.\n\nMuzzammil Ahussain, Chief Executive Officer of Almosafer, said: \"The incredible appetite for travel remains undiminished in the Kingdom and our report shows that people continue to grasp opportunities to travel both internationally and domestically. They are spending more money on longer trips and meaningful experiences when they travel. What is also becoming apparent is that Saudi Arabia has become a leisure destination for many Saudis who are beginning to discover the wealth of attractions at their own doorstep.\"\n\nAs a national champion of tourism in Saudi Arabia, Almosafer will continue to capitalise on growing demand for tourism, catering the needs of its customers and supporting the tourism agenda of Saudi Vision 2030.\n\nView the full report here https://cms-cdn.almosafer.com/alm_trends_report/ALM_trends_report_2023_EN.pdf.\n\nReport based on proprietary booking data from Almosafer’s Consumer Travel Business across omnichannel touchpoints. Comparisons are based on bookings placed between January 1st – April 20th, 2019 vs. January 1st – April 20th in 2023.\n\n",

         "body":"Almosafer will run a year-long campaign highlighting the many attractions in the Kingdom\n\nThe Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) has signed a partnership agreement with Almosafer, Saudi Arabia’s leading travel company (part of Seera Group) to promote domestic tourism in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through its multiple businesses operating under the Almosafer umbrella.\n\nThe agreement was signed at a ceremony which took place at the Saudi Tourism Forum. The agreement builds on the long-standing relationship between Almosafer and STA in which the two parties have collaborated on various successful initiatives to boost tourism in the Kingdom to support the tourism pillar of Saudi Vision 2030.\n\nThere has been unprecedented demand for domestic tourism in recent years as many Saudis have begun to explore the unrivalled historical, cultural, natural and religious attractions in the Kingdom.   \n\nUnder the agreement, Almosafer will launch a year-long campaign to promote domestic tourism, highlighting the many attractions and experiences available in the Kingdom throughout the year and offering a range of discounts and promotions to further enable more Saudis to discover their own country. \n\nMuzzammil Ahussain, CEO of Almosafer, said: \"The appetite for domestic tourism remains incredibly strong as people are beginning to discover the many incredible attractions on their own doorstep. We are capitalising on this demand to help drive domestic tourism as we continue to develop our products and services to serve the travel needs of the Kingdom. As the national champion of tourism in Saudi Arabia, we will continue to work with STA to achieve our shared goal of supporting Saudi Vision 2030.\"\n\nWith Ramadan fast-approaching, families can celebrate together by booking a stay on Almosafer Chalets+, a digital platform for alternative accommodation. During the summer months, Saudis can explore cooler climes in the Kingdom, from the mountains of Abha to the rose fields of Taif, while the winter months will see the return of a whole host of events, from Riyadh season and MDL Beast to Formula One and Saudi Cup. \n\nAs the national champion of tourism in Saudi Arabia, and with a large customer base in the Kingdom, Almosafer is well-positioned to boost domestic tourism by leveraging each of its businesses. Almosafer will promote the campaign directly to Saudis through its consumer segment; leverage the tours offered by Discover Saudi, the destination management company; and further drive Umrah+ packages offered by Mawasim, the Hajj and Umrah tour operator, to offer an enhanced all-in-one trip that combines religious and leisure tourism.

         "title":"Mawasim unveils Umrah travel trends at 2023 Conference & Exhibition for Hajj and Umrah Services",
         "body":"Hajj and Umrah tour operator Mawasim, part of Almosafer – Seera Group’s travel platform, has recorded strong growth in Umrah bookings, with its new offices in Indonesia and Pakistan driving significant growth in pilgrim arrivals. The two countries are also the top international markets for Umrah bookings for Mawasim in 2022.\n\nUnveiling the new trends in Umrah travel at the 2023 Conference & Exhibition for Hajj and Umrah Services (Hajj Expo), the largest conference and exhibition for Hajj and Umrah services, Mawasim forecast exceptional growth for the coming year, with pilgrim arrivals from focus markets including Egypt, Algeria, India, Turkey, Malaysia, Iraq and Jordan, in addition to Indonesia and Pakistan. \n\nAt Hajj Expo, organised by the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, Mawasim is showcasing its competencies and proven track record in delivering seamless Umrah services for pilgrims from around the world. The company reported strong growth in the last two quarters of 2022, despite the late start of Umrah, welcoming nearly 31,000 pilgrims from 43 countries and working with over 214 agents. \n\nPilgrims accounted for a total of 81,730 room nights across 114 hotels with the largest number of bookings coming from Pakistan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Singapore and Egypt.\n\nWith travel restrictions limiting Umrah arrivals from inbound markets during the pandemic, pilgrims have returned to make the most of their spiritual trips to Makkah and Madinah with group trips averaging 8 days and 40 passengers per booking. \n\nThe increase in Umrah travel follows recent reforms in Saudi Arabia permitting visitors to perform Umrah on any visa, in addition to general visa policies that have eased access to the Kingdom with residents of the GCC now being able to obtain a visa on arrival. \n\nMawasim’s successful integration of Maqam, the official global distribution platform of the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, has led to an increase in online adoption from its customers, with Mawasim’s online portal offering users a seamless experience. \n\nThe Maqam portal has generated demand for Mawasim’s ‘Umrah+’ packages, which provide pilgrims with an enhanced all-in-one trip combining Umrah and leisure. Umrah+ offers city tours of Makkah, Madinah and Taif, which are amongst the most popular activities. There is a growing appetite from pilgrims to explore such attractions in their Kingdom during their visit.\n\nMawasim is now also live on the Nusuk platform on both individual and business channels. Nusuk is the first-ever official planning, booking and experience platform, developed as part of the Pilgrimage Experience Program under Vision 2030, which creates an Umrah itinerary to Makkah, Madina, and beyond. Travellers from all over the world can easily organise their entire visit, from applying for an eVisa to booking hotels and flights. \n\nMuzzammil Ahussain, EVP of Almosafer, said: \"Hajj Expo 2023 is an excellent opportunity to connect with stakeholders in the industry and to work together to enhance the Hajj and Umrah travel experience. We are showcasing our track record in driving strong bookings from international markets by operating with our extensive network of agents. We look forward to strengthening our role as a strategic partner in enhancing bookings, and our latest data reveals that demand for Umrah travel continues to grow. We will continue to meet this demand by expanding our offering and leveraging our decades of experience to ensure that every pilgrim experiences an unforgettable journey.\" \n\nData from Almosafer’s consumer segment, the Middle East’s leading travel brand, also highlights the growing demand for Umrah travel, with an increase in hotel and flight bookings for the cities of Makkah and Madinah on its platforms. GBV for these two cities has increased by 30% in 2022 compared to 2019.",
